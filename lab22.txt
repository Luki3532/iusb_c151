Git and GitHub
Part 1. Create a GitHub account and a project
1. Go to https://github.com/ 
2. Create a GitHub account if you do not have one.
3. Create a public project/repository (iusb_c151) and add a text file (lab22.txt) with any 
information inside.
4. In your GitHub account, go to the project folder. Click “Code” and copy the Clone URL.
Part 2. Use Git from Linux
5. Use Putty to logon to cs01.cs.iusb.edu.
6. Create a new folder Lab22 under C151 and switch into it.
7. Set your account’s default identity by running the following git commands (for first time user 
only). Replace blue text with your own information.
$ git config --global user.email you@youremail.com
$ git config --global user.name your_github_username
$ git config -l
8. To clone the GitHub repository, execute the following command (replace url with the one 
you copied at Step 4):
$ git clone url
9. The project (iusb_c151) on GitHub is copied to your local repository.
10. Switch into the local repository.
$ cd iusb_c151
11. Open File: Lab22.txt.
12. Add a new line of text to the end of the file.
13. Save the changes.
14. Execute the following commands.
$ git add -A (select the files for commit of changes)
$ git commit -m “change a file” (the changes are made to the repository)
$ git push (push the local changes to GitHub)
15. Enter username and password if asked.
16. If authentication fails, please do Steps 17-19. Otherwise go to Step 20.
17. Create Access Token on GitHub.
• Click on your GitHub profile icon on the top right corner.
• Click Settings.
• From the menu shown on the left, click Developer Settings.
• Click Personal access tokens.
• Click Generate new token.
• Add a note that will help you identify the scope of the access token to be generated.
• Choose the Expiration period from the drop down menu.
• Finally, select the scopes you want to grant the corresponding access to the 
generated access token. I will check all of them.
• Finally click Generate Token.
• Copy the token and save it on your desktop computer.
18. On Linux, execute the following command to reset authentication method.
$ git remote set-url origin https://<token>@github.com/<user>/<repository>.git
In the above command make sure to replace:
• <token> with the personal access token you have copied in the previous step
• <user> with your GitHub username
• <repository> with the name of your GitHub repository (iusb_c151)
19. Execute the following command to push the change again.
